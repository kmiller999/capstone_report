        "The growth of data science as a field has produced simultaneous increases in role diversification. The present study further characterized differences between job roles by examining whether experience levels varied between data science job categories. This study focused on a subset of publicly available data comprising data science employees working full-time in the U.S. (*N* = 12,389). A Chi-Square Test of Independence with subsequent post hoc tests analyzed the association between experience level and job category. A Random Forest Regression model was used to predict salaries from experience level, job category, and work setting. Experience level composition varied between job categories (*X^2^* = 1003.54, *p* \\< .001), with each job category differing from all others (*p*-range: *p* \\< .001 - *p* = .001). Residual analysis revealed two experience level-job category intersections with substantially greater observed counts than expected: executive employees in leadership roles and entry-level employees in data analysis roles. Employees in these experience levels were otherwise underrepresented, whereas senior employees comprised a sizable portion of each job category. The Random Forest Regression model explained roughly 25% of the variance in employee salary. Salary estimates were higher for employees in machine learning or AI-related roles or senior positions, and lower for employees in data analysis roles. This study further characterized differences between data science roles, most notably for experience levels typically found in each. These findings have implications for the accessibility of these roles, particularly for entry-level employees, who may have fewer attainable job roles.\n",

        "After being heralded as the \"sexiest job of the 21st century\" [@davenport2012], the data scientist role met these lofty expectations [@davenport2022], and is expected to continue growing through 2032 [@datasci2024]. The responsibilities of this role grew simultaneously, requiring more specialized data science roles be created to focus on a portion of the data science process [@davenport2022]. Examples of these expanded roles include the data engineer and data analyst [@rosidi2023], with the former focusing on the quality and accessibility of data and the latter focusing on analysis and reporting of data. Yet with seemingly more job roles, demand, and resources to learn data science than ever [@davenport2022], many of those attempting to break into the field find themselves frustrated and disillusioned [@selvaraj2022].\n",
        "\n",
        "This mismatch between the expectations and experiences of data science hopefuls underscores the need to characterize the skills and experiences necessary to succeed in a data science role. Greater transparency surrounding these factors would demystify the field as a whole and provide a better road map for employment-ready data science professionals. Using an open dataset on data science jobs from Kaggle [@zangari], this study sought to discern whether there was a categorical association between experience level and job category in data science jobs. Following a statistically significant Chi-Square Test of Independence omnibus test, the experience level composition of individual job categories would be compared using the same Chi-Square test. An additional Random Forest Regression (RFR) model was used to estimate salary from experience level, job category, and work setting.\n",

The main adaptation made in the Kaggle version was the addition of the `job_categories` feature, which collapsed 149 unique job titles into ten general categories. This was highly advantageous for the scope of this study, as it would be difficult to compare and interpret differences between 149 different job titles."

Since some features pertained to similar constructs (e.g., `job_title` and `job_category`), it was important to gauge the usability of features and levels therein. For instance, some features had a large number of levels (e.g., `job_title`, `employee_residence`, and `company_location`), which can be difficult to analyze. Additionally, features like `employment_type`, `employee_residence`, and `company_location` exhibited considerable categorical imbalances, with the vast majority of responses belonging to one category."

        "Due to categorical imbalances shown in the previous section, the dataset was filtered to only include employees residing in the U.S. (`employee_residence`), working for a U.S.-based company (`company_location`), and working full-time (`employment_type`). While this reduced the potential generalizability of findings, it was important to recognize that the data was already biased towards these groups, and any attempt to generalize beyond that would be undermined to begin with. Filtering for these categories reduced the number of observations to 12,389, which constituted less than 13% data loss. Features `work_setting` and `company_size` were not filtered to remedy categorical imbalances, as each feature contained only three levels, and the degree of the imbalance was less concerning. Potential outliers and skewness in `salary_in_usd` were not treated, as Random Forest models are robust to outliers and extreme values [@deori2023], and high salaries were potentially noteworthy in the RFR model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of the twelve original features, only four were kept for analyses: `experience_level`, `salary_in_usd`, `work_setting`, and `job_category`. After filtering for `employment_type`, `employee_residence`, `company_location`, these three features were excluded on the basis that each was no longer a variable (i.e., each only had one value). The feature `job_category` was used place of `job_title`, as the former had far lower cardinality (i.e., ten unique value vs. 149), making it far easier to incorporate in analyses. Filtering by country meant `salary_in_usd` could be used in place of `salary` and `salary_currency`, as conversions would not be necessary. Features `work_year` and `company_size` would have been nice to add to the salary estimation Random Forest Regression model, but both had sub-optimal distributions and level structures to analyze."

The a-priori criteria defined in this project's proposal was that any job categories with fewer than five expected counts in any cell would be combined with other job categories meeting this criteria. Such low expected counts would be abnormally low for a dataset of this size, and collapsing categories can serve as a sound solution without incurring data loss [@bewick2003]. The job categories Cloud and Database, Data Management and Strategy, and Data Quality and Operations all had fewer than five expected counts for at least one experience level, leading these to be combined into one category (see @tbl-exp-cts-1). Rather than labeling this category as \"Other,\" these categories all pertained to Data Management, which served as a more descriptive label (see @tbl-exp-cts-2). The final cross tabulation to be used in the Chi-Square analysis was saved as `trans_refined_ct`."

While added sparsity from OHE features can reduce model efficiency and performance [@ravi2022], other encoding methods that do not increase sparsity (e.g., integer or ordinal encoding) can create unintended relationships between feature levels [@brownlee2020]. Such ordered relationships would have been defensible for features `experience_level` and `work_setting`, but these were also encoded using an OHE method for consistency with the `job_category` feature. By using the `ColumnTransformer()` function to apply OHE, the target variable, `salary_in_usd`, was left unaffected, and the output was automatically transformed into a pandas dataframe. This resulted in seventeen OHE features, corresponding to the levels of `experience_level` (*n* = 4), `work_setting` (*n* = 3), and `job_category` (*n* = 10)."

Instead of printing these comparisons as in the original code, converting to and printing a dataframe yielded a cleaner output (see @tbl-chi-sig). Given the large dataset at hand, a more stringent Bonferroni correction was used to correct for alpha inflation [@jafari2019], as this method multiples the statistical significance by the number of comparisons made. Despite this, all 28 comparisons were statistically significant after the Bonferroni correction (Bonferroni-corrected *p*-range: *p* \\< .001 - *p* = .001). Focusing instead on the magnitude of the effect size in terms of *X^2^*, the three strongest effects resulted from comparisons with Data Analysis (compared to Data Engineer, Machine Learning and AI, and Data Science and Research, respectively). The visualizations in the following suggest that Data Analysis had more Entry-level employees relative to the comparison categories."

        "The contingency cross tabulation tables are shown below for the observed (see @tbl-ct-figs-1) and expected counts (see @tbl-ct-figs-2). Rather than focusing on these individually, a residual table was created to show observed counts deviated from the expected counts for each cell (see @tbl-ct-figs-3). Residuals were calculated as the difference between the observed and expected counts divided by the expected values ((O - E) / E), which yields both the direction and magnitude of difference between the two. The accompanying heatmap (see @fig-chi-heatmap) shows where counts were greater than expected in red (e.g., Entry-level and Data Analysis or Executive and Leadership and Management) and fewer than expected in blue (e.g., Entry-level and Data Architecture and Modeling or Executive and Data Management). The bivariate plots compare the experience level composition across job categories, using the proportion (@fig-chi-bivariate-1) and count of employees (@fig-chi-bivariate-2) with each experience level. @fig-chi-bivariate-1 re-iterates the findings that Data Analysis for Entry-level employees and Leadership and Management for Executive employees were relative peaks among less-represented experience levels. Conversely, Senior employees comprised a sizable portion of every job category, and the clear majority of a few (e.g., Data Architecture and Modeling, Machine Learning and AI). @fig-chi-bivariate-2 uses number of employees for the y-axis variable, which takes into account size differences between job categories. This again depicts the relative commonality of Senior employees, as three of four largest categories (Data Science and Research, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning and AI) contained a substantial number of Senior employees."

With root-mean-squared error (*RMSE*) as the a-priori error metric for the RFR model, the scoring metric for the grid search object was set to `neg_root_mean_squared_error`. This grid search object was supplied a default RFR model and the parameter grid, and subsequently fit to the `X_train` and `y_train` datasets for five cross-validation folds.

        "The training model performance was evaluated from the grid search object directly, from which the *RMSE* and *R^2^* values were extracted. The final RFR model was created with tuned hyperparameters and fit to `X_train` and `y_train`, and subsequently used to predict `y_test` using `X_test`. Model performance was comparable in the training (*RMSE* = 53,050.72, *R^2^* = .2448) and testing models (*RMSE* = 54,352.70, *R^2^* = .2525). The testing model performance indicates that the features explained roughly 25% of the variance in salary, and the salary estimates were off by roughly \\$54,000 on average. The convergence between the error and explained variance metrics between the training and testing models suggest the model was not overfit to the training data."

The top three features included the Data Analysis job category (.286), Machine Learning and AI job category (.162), and Senior experience level (.136). Unsurprisingly, these were the first three features used to split the data in the RFR tree diagram (see @fig-tree-three), which underscores each feature's importance to estimating salary. The code for this diagram was adapted from a TensorFlow tutorial [@visualiz2024], and this figure makes it easy to interpret how the absence or presence of an experience level, job category, or work setting altered the RFR model's salary estimate. With the depth of the model, however, only the first three levels of the diagram could be displayed before the clarity of the figure diminished."

        "The results of the Chi-Square Test of Independence were statistically significant (see section [4.A.1: Omnibus]), thus rejecting the null hypothesis that the experience level of employees did not vary between job categories (see section [1.1: Research Question and Hypotheses]). With regards to this study's research question, experience level composition varied between job categories, which suggests that some data science positions are typically held by more experienced employees than others. One limitation of using a Chi-Square test with this data was that it may have been overpowered, as all job category post hoc comparisons exhibited significant differences, even following a Bonferroni correction (see section [4.A.2: Post Hoc Tests]). This shifted the focus from statistical significance of the comparisons to the magnitude of the effects, as quantified by the *X^2^* values and the residuals, (see section [4.A.3: Chi-Square Visualizations] for visualizations). Both metrics converged to suggest the Data Analysis job category was unique in its distribution of experience levels, which featured the highest proportion of entry-level employees.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the RFR model was not intended to test or evaluate hypotheses, the final model performed relatively well considering the challenges of the data (see section [4.B.2: Train and Test Model Performance]). The features accounted for more than one-quarter of the variance in salary, which is impressive considering the fourteen encoded features originated from only three features. One limitation described in section [3.B.1: Encoding Section] was the use of sparse categorical data in the RFR model, which has been shown to diminish performance or interpretability in some Random Forest models [@ravi2022]. Interestingly, the RFR testing model performance (*R^2^*) outperformed the training model slightly (.2525 compared to .2448), which was unexpected. This can likely be attributed to the idiosyncratic, random nature of the train-test-split function (see section [3.B.3: Train-Test-Split]), which may have given the testing set a slightly \"easier\" dataset to predict. Since the training model had a better *RMSE* value than the testing set (53,050.72 compared to 54,352.70), the training model still estimated salary better than the testing set, and the unexpected *R^2^* comparison is likely not concerning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results of this study may be helpful for characterizing the field of data science at large. Firstly, the analyses using the data at hand suggest that entry-level positions are relatively rare in data science. This may lend credence to the idea that fewer entry-level positions are available in the field [@selvaraj2022], although, further studies should investigate this claim. The relative spike of entry-level employees in the data analysis job category supports multiple resources cited here [@selvaraj2022; @simmons2023]. Each of these suggested a data analyst position may be an intermediate step for an entry-level employee to become a data scientist, and the results of this study suggest this may be plausible. Lastly, the results of the RFR model suggest some experience levels, job categories, and work settings tend to earn a higher salary than others. Notably, employees in the Data Analysis job category tended to earn less, whereas Senior employees, or employees in the Machine Learning and AI job category tended to earn more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Four considerations for future studies examining the field of data science are recommended following analyses here. One technical improvement would be to use an RFR model with non-sparse categorical features, to see if this potentially improves model performance or interpretability. An alternative to the scikit-learn workflow is the Distributed Random Forest model from @distribu2024, which can incorporate nominal feature structures without requiring transformations. Concerning the association between experience level and job category, obtaining each employee's entry-level position to data science would help create more holistic, trajectory-based snapshots of data science careers. This could also disentangle whether some roles with higher proportions of entry-level employees (e.g., Data Analysis) could feasibly serve as an intermediate step to another position [@selvaraj2022; @simmons2023]. Concerning the RFR model, including more features that might be associated with data science salaries (e.g., education level, years of employment, or geographic location) could improve salary estimates and model performance. Lastly, acquiring more stratified data with respect to employee status, employee residence, and company location would help generalize analyses beyond full-time employees, residing in the U.S., and working for a U.S.-based company.\n",
